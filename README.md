## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing experimental co-pyrolysis data to understand how process parameters such as **temperature**, **heating rate**, and **reaction time** influence the production of **Bio-Oil**, **Biochar**, and **Gas**.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow, including:

- Data preparation using SQL Server
- Analytical SQL queries
- Views and stored procedures
- Power BI dashboard development
- DAX calculations
- Interactive visualizations
